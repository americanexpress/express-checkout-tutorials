## Introduction to the Developer Portal

American Express powers billions of transactions worldwide. To make its software more accessible, Amex released the [Developer Portal](https://developer.americanexpress.com/home) in October 2016. As of this article, 12 APIs are featured on the portal in the following categories:

* Fraud Prevention
* Payment Services
* Personalization Services
* Utilities

The Developer Portal is publically available and free to access.

## Express Checkout

In these articles, we have focused solely on Amex Express Checkout. Express Checkout offers the ability to securely and easily checkout on a merchant website, by using an American Express login to autofill Card details and Account information. You can find the official documentation on the [documentation tab](https://developer.americanexpress.com/documentation) as well as the [products tab](https://developer.americanexpress.com/products) of the Developer Portal.
